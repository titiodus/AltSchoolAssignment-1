# AltSchool Assignment-1
## Project Goal: Build a simple HTML & CSS driven web application made up of a few linked pages and styled content
I created a HTML page with the following information: Home page which I called About Me with contact page, register page login page links at the top of the About me page.
<p> The following were included in my About Me page: My name. A little about me. My goal for the Diploma course I am running with AltSchool Africa. My Education (my past education and certificates). My Job experience and my hobbies & skills
<p> The Contact section within my About me page was done using a form with the following fields: Name, Email, Message, Priority (this is dropdown option). The form has a submit button and basic HTML validation.
<p> My register page has the following fields with HTML validation as well:First Name, Last Name, Phone, Gender (dropdown option), Country, State/province, Username, Password & Confirm password.
<p> My Login page has a username field and a password field with basic HTML validation to the login form. It has a submit button with the label of “Sign In”
<p>  My About me page has a navigation menu at the top. It links the pages together so that there’s no dead end and you can always go from the home page to the other pages and then back to the home page.
<p> I also created a Calculator page and created a calculator UI in it, using the HTML Table element. I will be back to make the calculator functional, but the goal for now is to make it look great using what I had learnt about HTML & CSS. The Calculator has: A text field at the top, Numbers 0 to 9 and Regular Maths operators like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulo (%)
<p> I added a photo of myself
<p> As a bonus task, I re-created the calculator UI in a new page, using CSS flexbox instead of using a table.
